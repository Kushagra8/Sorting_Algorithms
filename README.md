This project explores various sorting algorithms implemented in Python. Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to organize data efficiently. This project demonstrates different sorting techniques and their performance. The code takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sorted array for each sorting algorithm. The algorithms are implemented as functions that take an array as input and return the sorted array.

Selection Sort
Description: Selection sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly locates the minimum element within an unsorted section of an array and swaps it with the first element in that section. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
Efficiency: While effective for small arrays, selection sort exhibits a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario, making it less efficient for larger datasets.

Bubble Sort
Description: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that iteratively compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order until the entire array is sorted. The process continues until no more swaps are required.
Efficiency: Bubble sort also has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario, making it best suited for smaller arrays or educational purposes.

Insertion Sort
Description: Insertion sort constructs the final sorted array incrementally, one element at a time. It starts by assuming the first element is sorted and inserts subsequent unsorted elements into their proper positions within the sorted part of the array.
Efficiency: While insertion sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), it excels for small arrays and nearly sorted data, where it achieves a best-case time complexity of O(n).

Merge Sort
Description: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits an array into two halves, sorts each half independently, and then merges them back into a single sorted array. The merging process involves comparing elements from both halves and merging them in ascending order.
Efficiency: Merge sort boasts a favorable average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for sorting large arrays.

Quick Sort
Description: Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array into subarrays based on the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays. It's known for its efficient average-case performance.
Efficiency: Quick sort typically exhibits an average-case time complexity of O(n log n). However, in rare worst-case scenarios, it can degrade to O(n^2). Techniques like random pivot selection or ensuring balanced partitioning are used to mitigate the worst-case performance.
These concise descriptions can be included in your resume to highlight your knowledge of sorting algorithms and your ability to analyze their efficiency.
